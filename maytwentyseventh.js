/*
There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value. 
You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules: 

Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).

A team is valid if:  
(rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams and position matters).

Example 1:Input: 
rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3

Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 
Example 2:â€¨

Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.

Example 3:
Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]


CQs
arr length < 3 return Never will happen
ijk will never equal each other
All numbers are unique

pseudo:
set up three pointers to i j and k
set up count
iterated over array to get i
since j has to be less than or more than i only look for k's that are corresponding to that direction
once i find k that fulfillls the critera i would add one ot the count

Output: 4


Example 1:Input: 
rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
ratingI=4
ratingJ=1
ratingK=1
count=3
output->3
